<h1> Open issues </h1> 

<li> how to send users the Weka models: 
currently we're providing only results as link by email. 
(We proceed to provide a link to other Weka products: affs, models, res files). 

<li> 'CEO model' is quite a different matter as we do not intend to share the code
(we probably provide a perl binary executable that replicates not only the CV run
but also has the option of implementing CEO model against unseen test set)

<li> how (long) to store Weka models on our server:
current idea is to keep the Weka models for a few days on our server, 
notify client repeatedly and then delete them (this is because average size of project is 20-50MB
and we would ultimately run out of storage space). 

<li> whether to consider results obtained with Weka Online subject to Weka's copyleft (GPL) licence?
(This requires community-wide discussion so I will put that in our next launch message on Wekalist).
