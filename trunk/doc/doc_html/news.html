<!--
<li> Substratified cross-validation mode: August 2008. 
(This will be shown to ensure maximal robustness of full data training model against new test sets better than stratified CV employed in Weka and elsewhere.
See <a href="robuster.html" target=main>RoBuster</a>)
<li> Apriori best algorithm selection (BAS) module: August 2008.
(This heart of CEO algorithm reduces dramatically the time required to finding best algorithm and optimising it, with other enabled procedures at time saved)
<li> Solution to low-train datasets: fall 2008. See <a href="enricher.html" target=main>EnRicher</a>
<li> Solution to high-train datasets (custom feature selection method): fall 2008. 
<li> Making preprints of primary publication (PP) and Founder's thesis (THE) available: August 2008.
(Till then we work with clients' questions individually and add descriptions to site as is required)
<li> Making Weka Online have all (most) features of the three different Weka interfaces (commandline, Explorer, Experimenter) 
including all the executable types (classifiers, regressors, feature selectors, association rule generators etc.) combined in a single fast run -->
