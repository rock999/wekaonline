<h1> CEO Basics </h1> 

<p> There are two separate products hosted and maintained on this site: 
<p><b>Weka Online</b> is basically a 'borne again Weka' with web access (therefore free), with key Weka features and some more as considered useful. 
Our consummate purpose is to complement Weka, e.g. in terms of providing one interface to cover all the outputs of Weka interfaces (commandline, Explorer and Experimenter).
Weka Online can be considered in many ways an improvement over earlier developped meta-classification suites (WekaMetal/MetaWeka). 
WebWeka/GridWeka(2) are also improved upon in the sense that we consider CEO/Weka Online the first serious attempt to provide an online classification suite.</p>
 
<p> Weka Online utilises <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/" target="main">Weka</a> classification suite 
distributed under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="main">GPL</a> licence.

<p><b>CEO (algorithm)</b> in turn is implementation of innovations confirmedly improving on state of art accuracy by the integrated base classifiers. 
Note therefore that <b>CEO is not Weka</b>. It rather has (or can have) Weka, i.e. it deploys (currently/mostly) classification algorithms implemented in Weka. 
Weka Online is just an online implementation of Weka, with some things left out and some features added. 
CEO has unique methods shown to contribute to beneficial time*accuracy ratio that will not be implemented in Weka Online.
CEO algorithm ('clever ensembling operator') is a selective meta-learning algorithm based on findings in Founder's PhD thesis project 2004-2008 (see Publications). 
It has been programmed during 2007-2008 largely by Co-Founder (assisted and designed by Founder).
Its apriori best algorithm selection (BAS) module enables running of adequate number of algorithms in reasonable time and to increase classification accuracy.
