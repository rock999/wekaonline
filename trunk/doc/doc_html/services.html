<p> We provide along with the software the following: 

	<li> Analysing results, estimating need for further actions for optimal result
	<li> Preprocessing your dataset (e.g. csv2arff, feature selections)
	<li> Transforming the output to your information management system

<p> We can also take your project and run it from its current format to training model that delivers optimal accuracy.
<p> We specialise in finding the best classifier for your dataset and slightly nonconventional but useful approaches
which we can implement at a fairly quick revision cycle.
