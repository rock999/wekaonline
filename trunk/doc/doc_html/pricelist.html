<h1> Pricelist principles </h1>

<p> We want a fair pricing for all prospective customers but we also need to ensure we get our price range right. 
With that in mind licence fee needs to consist of the following: 

	<li> <u>Base fee</u>: licence for first year includes use of CEO with support
	<li> <u>Annual fee</u>: licence for each year following that (20% of base fee)
	<li> <u>Support fee</u>: in case client wants more support than is justified by the base fee (-> Services)
	<li> <u>Frequent usage fee </u>('pay per use'): clients with 1 project per year get off cheaper wrt clients with 100 projects. 
	<li> <u>Upgrade fee</u>: CEO is likely to have several editions as time goes on, 
	latter ones providing more gain over baseline than current ones.
	For that to be recompensated to us and provided to client of current version, 
	there will be an 'upgrade fee' which is not the full price difference
	(Obviously this upgrading will be optional to the client). 
	<li> <u>How much you can afford</u>: individuals get it cheaper than corporations, students cheaper than professionals. 
	<li> Note also that compared to many other classification suites, we do not licence CEO per user per machine per year.
