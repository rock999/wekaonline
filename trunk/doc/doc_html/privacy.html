<h1> Privacy statement </h1> 

<p> Often people have datasets that are either proprietary or they do not wish for other reasons to make either their datasets or results public.
<p> In Weka Online, we have made and will make further measures to ensure that (currently username*projectname protected, email if it is provided), 
(i.e. sql query in results page does not have any 'rlike' statements but only '='.) 
CEO Online users in contrast will have the sovereign right to protect everything related to their runs (user*project*email*password protection).

<br>
<p> In principle, however, we believe in the ultimate gain-for-all from almost complete transparency wrt results.
We wish to guide the machine-learning field to making public their Weka Online results, for the general benefit (not really ours) of advances in the field. 
To set an example to this effect, we make our proteins/WSD/UCI runs public. See also <a href="livebench.html" target="main">this plan</a>.

<p> We respect the complete privacy of our users. Therefore, we included in the submission form the option of erasing the project files from the database.
If you tick that ('do not share' option), only the results (classifier performance at dataset) remain in the database. 
So any usage of your datasets by us or other users is not possible without your explicit consent as expressed in the 'do not share' option.
