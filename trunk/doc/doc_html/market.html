<h1> State of the art </h1>

<p> There are numerous decision-making systems from the field of machine-learning and data-mining.
An up-to-date (2008) list of primary actors is found <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/companies/products.html" target=main>here</a>.
You will find most suites are based each solely on either neural networks (NN) or decision trees (Dtree). 
While these algorithms are renowned for their interpretable (back-trackable) models and visual output, 
they by far are not always the most accurate ones. We challenge all users to think about what they value: 
appearance or performance.

<p> Let us compare CEO with state of the art suites in terms of properties: <br> <img src="market-properties.jpg"><br>
<p> While it doesn't provide a polished GUI or graphical modules, CEO is the only tool on the market to perform classifier preselection and provide a supercluster to its clients' use.
This in our mind is what counts: performance over appearance.


<h1> Price ranges </h1>

<p> Have a look at prices of equivalent software: <br><img src="market-lookup.jpg"><br><br>
More specific pricelist will be provided at launch of the CEO software.
What can already be said is that we will be cheaper than any of these, not only providing more accurate than any of them 
and faster than most of them and pretty easy to use anywhere you are (and by focusing on the essential not so confusing). 
We aim to fulfill the criteria for a good DM (data mining) suite outlined <a href="http://www.dmreview.com/specialreports/20040323/1000465-1.html" target=main>here</a>
so that ultimately we can humbly say we and our customers disagree with their 'there is not best tool overall' claim.
