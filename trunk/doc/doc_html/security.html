<h1> Security assurance </h1>

<p> We take very seriously the security of our clients' projects and integrity of our code:

<li> User registration with validation of email address and user-chosen (changeable) password. 
It is not possible to submit without registration. 

<li> Validation of the submission form fields (details of this validation will not be made public obviously).
We automatically validate sent datasets. This will make it impossible for a user to submit anything to our server that is not related to classification.

<li> Recording of connecting -> registering -> submitting servers (with a timestamp and nature of activity): 
we will block known spamming and hacking services.

<li> Password-protected and encrypted scripts (with backups so we can in worst case scenario get back up the next day)

<p> Any illicit use will be recorded. If there is a sign of attempted hacking, copying or other unauthorised activity, 
actions will be taken, notification sent to that server's administrator (notifiying of probable abuse)
and potentially some legal actions in the illicit submitter's country of residence.

<p> Regular users need not worry about this. This is just in place for both our and your security.
