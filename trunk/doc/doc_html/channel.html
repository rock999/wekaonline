<h1> Distribution channels </h1> 

<p> Currently CEO only has the distribution channels that its founders have from their own affiliates and experience.
We are looking for partners to distribute the program in their own fields, in its online or localised form.
To propose / hear terms of becoming a distributor, drop a line to me (harri.saarikoski@ceodelegates.com).
We are particularly interested in distributors specialised in marketing software to businesses 
requiring superior machine-assisted decision-making (e.g. medical, biotech, financial predictions).

<p> Reimbursement from being a licenced distributor is in sales revenue or in 'CEO stock' as separately agreed upon.
