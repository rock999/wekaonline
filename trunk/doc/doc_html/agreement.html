<h1> CEO Online Software License Agreement </h1>

<p> This licence concerns the use of CEO Online while its local and customised implementations are agreed on separately. 
(Weka Online is under GPL licence and can be used without explicit licence agreement.)

<ol>

<li> I agree hereby that I am the only user of CEO. I will not communicate my user access codes to third parties.
I agree not to use CEO SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE SOFTWARE CONCURRENTLY ON TWO OR MORE COMPUTERS OR IN A LOCAL AREA NETWORK OR OTHER NETWORK WITHOUT THE PRIOR 
WRITTEN CONSENT OF LICENSOR AND THE PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL LICENSE FEES.

<li> I acknowledge and agree that Licensor's Software contains valuable proprietary unpublished trade secrets owned by Licensor and its suppliers. CEO Software 
and User Documentation are also protected under International Treaty provisions.  You further acknowledge and agree that all right, title, and interest in 
and to the Program are and shall remain with Licensor.  No right, license, or interest to any trademark of Licensor is granted hereunder, and you agree that 
no such right, license, or interest shall be asserted by you with respect to any trademark of Licensor. In case you plan to use CEO in your publication, CEO requires that you refer to the Primary Publication

<li> Licensor's cumulative liability to you or any other party for any loss or damages resulting from claims, demands, or actions arising out of or relating to 
this Agreement shall not exceed the license fee paid to Licensor for the use of the Program.  In no event shall Licensor be liable for any indirect, 
incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages or lost profits, even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  SOME STATES 
DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL, DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

<!-- <li> YOU MAY NOT USE CEO SOFTWARE FOR ANY ACTIVITY OTHER THAN TEACHING OR NOT-FOR-PROFIT RESEARCH WITHOUT THE EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION OF CEO. -->

with its account and all stored files and user information will be subject to deletion without notification. Licensor will not 
refund paid licences. 

<li> Upon receiving the licence fee, Licensor shall provide you with CEO access codes.
