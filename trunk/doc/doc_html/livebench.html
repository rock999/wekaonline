<h1> LiveBench(TM): Obtaining critical mass </h1> 
<p> We are designing a forum where practitioners from any field of machine-learning (designer or end-user) 
can compare their algorithm's performance against public benchmark datasets instead of waiting for
the usual bi/triannual evaluation workshops in ML (e.g. SemEval for NLP, CASP for proteins). 

<p> Here instead practitioners could compare their algorithm's performance and discuss the results
and the individual contributors publishing papers on their joint solution without CEO claiming anything. 
We believe missing constant feedback is what ultimately leads to obtaining critical mass in classification accuracy improvement.
See <a href="contribute.html" target=main>here</a> for just one of the reasons why that should be done.

<p> (The forum is very much in design still, and will follow the finishing of numerous other tasks on this site.)
