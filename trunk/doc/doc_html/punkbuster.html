<h1> Busting the hacker punk (25-07-2008) </h1>

<p> He left a trail when he submitted the malicious script (see News). We noticed when hacking happened almost immediately so we have the sending IP address here.
<p> In fact, we would like to thank the little geek for so pointing out the only breech in our security. Measures will be taken next week. 
Got a fraction of our batch run code deleted for which we applaud his extraordinary 'intellect'. He also tried to copy (wget) our documentation (failed). 
<p> Who in ¤&%¤&# do you think you are?! There are serious (and now some pretty angry) people here working on serious projects
that benefit from tenthing the processing time. And this is FREE software that came from our backs you &%¤&%#! 
Sad to say, all signs indicate this is a member of Wekalist (response came within 12 hours of our last announcement).

<p> Please come again punk! Then we'll know.
